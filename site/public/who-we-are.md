# Who we are

FastPDLC was not built as a product. It was built because a payments platform
needed its product intent to stop rotting, and the thing that fixed it turned out to be worth
extracting.

## Colin Wynd

Built the product-as-code engine inside the pharthing /
 KibiPay payments platform, where it grew to cover 39 features, a concept catalogue and a
 rulebook, and became the platform's sole product CI gate. Extracted it as FastPDLC so
 other teams could use it — verified by a byte-identical parity test proving nothing
 was lost on the way out.

Every design decision in the tool came from something going wrong first: the staleness
 gate because specs silently diverged from builds, typed references because renames quietly
 orphaned business rules, plugins because a real migration cannot afford to drop any of its
 bespoke checks.

## Where it came from

The pharthing / KibiPay payments platform runs `fastpdlc validate` as its only
product gate, via a plugin that adds domain-specific checks. Every feature in the tool exists
because something went wrong without it: the staleness gate because specs silently diverged from
builds, typed references because renames quietly orphaned business rules, plugins because a real
migration cannot afford to lose any of its bespoke checks.

## What we believe

- **Gates check facts, not taste.** A validator that argues about judgement gets
 bypassed, and a bypassed gate is worse than none.
- **Codes are an API.** Diagnostic numbers are never renumbered, because
 everything downstream depends on them.
- **Ship the smallest thing that closes the loop.** Most of the value is two
 checks: do references resolve, and does the build match its sources.
