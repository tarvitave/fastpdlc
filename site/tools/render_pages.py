<p>If you provide your mobile number and tick the SMS consent box, you agree to receive text
messages from FastPDLC about product updates, release announcements, and service notifications

us. Check your plan if you are unsure.</p>

<h2>How to stop</h2>
<p>Reply <strong>STOP</strong> to any message to unsubscribe immediately. You will receive one
final confirmation and then nothing further. You can also
<a href="/contact.html">contact us</a> to be removed.</p>

<h1>Who we are</h1>

<p class="lede">FastPDLC was not built as a product. It was built because a payments platform
needed its product intent to stop rotting, and the thing that fixed it turned out to be worth
extracting.</p>

    <h2>Colin Wynd</h2>
    <div class="role">Founder &middot; author of FastPDLC</div>
    <p style="margin-top:0.9rem">Built the product-as-code engine inside the pharthing /
    KibiPay payments platform, where it grew to cover 39 features, a concept catalogue and a
    rulebook, and became the platform's sole product CI gate. Extracted it as FastPDLC so
    other teams could use it &mdash; verified by a byte-identical parity test proving nothing
    was lost on the way out.</p>
    <p>Every design decision in the tool came from something going wrong first: the staleness
    gate because specs silently diverged from builds, typed references because renames quietly
    orphaned business rules, plugins because a real migration cannot afford to drop any of its
    bespoke checks.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<h2>Where it came from</h2>
<p>The pharthing / KibiPay payments platform runs <code>fastpdlc validate</code> as its only
product gate, via a plugin that adds domain-specific checks. Every feature in the tool exists
because something went wrong without it: the staleness gate because specs silently diverged from
builds, typed references because renames quietly orphaned business rules, plugins because a real
migration cannot afford to lose any of its bespoke checks.</p>
<p>You can read more about what survived contact with production in
<a href="/blog/payments-case-study.html">what we learned running this in payments</a>.</p>

<h2>What we believe</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Gates check facts, not taste.</strong> A validator that argues about judgement gets
    bypassed, and a bypassed gate is worse than none.</li>
  <li><strong>Codes are an API.</strong> Diagnostic numbers are never renumbered, because
    everything downstream depends on them.</li>
  <li><strong>Ship the smallest thing that closes the loop.</strong> Most of the value is two
    checks: do references resolve, and does the build match its sources.</li>
</ul>
