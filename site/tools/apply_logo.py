"""Swap the wordmark-in-a-box for a real mark.

The old logo was a black tile with a speech-bubble tail -- borrowed wholesale from
the reference site and saying nothing about this product. The new mark is a tick
whose two endpoints are graph nodes: a validated graph, in one glyph, legible at
16px. The open node is the artifact you just changed; the green one is the check
that passed.
