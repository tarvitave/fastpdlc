summary: Decision records answer why. Product-as-code answers what is true now. Conflating them is why both rot.

Architecture decision records are one of the few documentation practices that reliably survives. They work because they are append-only: a decision is made, recorded, and never edited. Superseding one means writing a new record, not rewriting the old.

That immutability is exactly why ADRs cannot carry your current product model.

## Two different questions

An ADR answers **why did we choose this, and what did we know at the time**. Its value is historical. Reading a three-year-old ADR and finding it out of date is not a defect -- the decision really was made under those conditions.

A glossary answers **what does this word mean right now**. A rulebook answers **what invariants hold right now**. These must be current or they are actively harmful. There is no value in a glossary that documents what a term used to mean.

Teams get into trouble by storing the second kind of content in the first kind of document. The ADR says "we will call this a Payment", the name changes two years later, and the ADR is both correct as history and wrong as reference.

## Keep both, wired together

Model decisions as their own collection, with their own lifecycle:

```yaml
- name: decisions
  dir: decisions
  id_prefix: "ADR-"
  required: [id, title, status, date]
  fields: [title, status, date, supersedes, affects]
  enums:
    status: [proposed, accepted, superseded]
  references:
    - field: supersedes
      to: decisions
    - field: affects
      to: rules
```

Now `supersedes` is checked, so an ADR cannot claim to replace one that does not exist. `affects` links the decision to the invariants it changed, which is the query people actually want: *why is this rule the way it is?*

## The division of labour

- **Decisions** are immutable and dated. Never edit them; supersede them.
- **Terms and rules** are current and edited freely. Their history lives in git.

Both are typed artifacts in the same graph, and the references between them are validated. What you get is a current model you can trust, with a traceable path back to the reasoning -- without either document pretending to be the other.
