"""FastPDLC — the rubric, the gate, and the line that builds against them.

Declare your typed product artifacts (features, decisions, terms, rules, whatever
your project needs) in a ``product.config.yaml``; FastPDLC loads them, enforces the
schema + cross-references, compiles a JSON bundle, and fails CI if the committed
bundle drifts — turning a folder of hopeful markdown into code.

Three surfaces, in increasing order of ambition:

* ``build`` / ``validate`` — the compiler and the gate. Deterministic, two
  dependencies, no network. This is what CI runs.
* ``evidence`` — a content-addressed record of what was checked, when, on which
  commit, and with what result.
* ``orchestration`` — the agent-built lifecycle: Understand → Disambiguate (a
  human gate) → Design → Develop → Test → adversarial Verify, with bounded repair.
  Needs ``fastpdlc[agents]``; nothing else does.

The gate is never an agent. A judge that could be persuaded could not produce
evidence, so every station past it is deterministic or human by construction.
